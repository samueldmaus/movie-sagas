# Favorite Movies Gallery

## Description
_Duration: 2-Day Sprint_

This application gives the user access to a database of popular movies. When the app first loads, the title and poster of all the movies in the database will be displayed. To view the movie in more detail, the user can click on the 'info' icon below each movie. The icon will take the user to the details page where, in addition to the title and poster, the genre and a short description of the movie will be displayed. If a user wishes to add a movie to the database, they can select the 'add' icon at the top of the page. From there, they will be prompted to enter a title, image path/url, description, and genre for the new movie. Selected 'Add Movie' will add the new movie to the database and it will now be displayed on the home page along with the other movies.
